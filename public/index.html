<p>This chart shows the colors from Guild Wars 2, from the API (cached), as they look on cloth, leather, and metal respectively.  They may appear differently in-game, but these are the base values that are used by the game.  They are sorted by hue and then brightness, according to the cloth value in the API, to give it some semblence of order.
